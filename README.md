# sumYinRangeX

This is a C program that computes the sum of y values given a range of x values.

To run this program, you can do either of the two things: 
-	You can either run the makefile using the command "make". The makefile will compile the program automatically. 
-	If you want to manually compile the program, you have to first compile the program to object code using “gcc -g -c sumYinRangeX.c -o sumYinRangeX.o” and then you have to compile that object code to executable code using “gcc -g -o sumYinRangeX sumYinRangeX.o”

I ran and tested my program in the stdlinux server.
